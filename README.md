My frontend practice sites.
All templates were found in open access in the internet.

I'm working on this project through the VS Code.
You want to work on this project? You have to install following extensions for VSCode (Or use similar programs):

1.	SASS Compiler
		Configure compiler to work with './#source/style.scss' file. Compiled files must be located in './css' folder.
		VSCode extension:
			Name: Live Sass Compiler
			Id: ritwickdey.live-sass
			Description: Compile Sass or Scss to CSS at realtime with live browser reload.
			Version: 3.0.0
			Publisher: Ritwick Dey
			VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass
			
2.	Live Server
		I'm using AJAX in some projects. You have to run server on the web server to avoid errors with AJAX.
		VSCode extension:
			Name: Live Server
			Id: ritwickdey.liveserver
			Description: Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages
			Version: 5.6.1

Also some code work only in modern browsers.
As for me, I am using last version of google chrome.
